# Anomaly Detection System

## Overview
This project is an Anomaly Detection System built using machine learning techniques. The system is designed to identify unusual patterns that do not conform to expected behavior, often referred to as anomalies. This can be applied in various domains such as fraud detection, network security, fault detection, and more.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.
- **Model Training:** Using various machine learning algorithms to train the anomaly detection model.
- **Evaluation:** Assessing the performance of the model using different metrics.
- **Visualization:** Visualizing the anomalies and normal data points for better understanding.
